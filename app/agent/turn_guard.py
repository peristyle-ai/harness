"""In-flight turn registry + SIGTERM handling for the harness worker.

Why this exists
---------------
On 2026-10-21 21:12 an operator sent an agent a message ("ok ive made the actual
payment to sample employee, please register that in the accounts system...") and
got no reply, ever. The turn was accepted and ran for ~14 minutes
(39 agent iterations, ~55 tool calls) inside a gunicorn gthread worker.
The harness service was then restarted -- twice, 25 seconds apart -- to
deploy a streaming fix, and the restart killed the worker mid-turn.

The user turn was in the turns table. The assistant turn was not. The
UI showed Mal's message and silence, and no amount of refreshing would
change that.

Why a registry
--------------
gunicorn's worker handles SIGTERM by stopping its accept loop
(gunicorn/workers/gthread.py:280). The in-flight request lives in a
ThreadPoolExecutor thread; when the process goes away, that thread
dies with it and the agent loop's `finally` block never gets to write
the partial turn it would otherwise persist on a client disconnect.

So the worker cannot rely on the request thread to clean up after
itself. This module keeps a process-local registry of the turns that
are currently running, and installs a SIGTERM handler that writes an
"interrupted" assistant turn for every registered turn BEFORE gunicorn
gets to exit the process.

Two details that matter:

* The handler CHAINS, it does not replace. gunicorn installs its own
  SIGTERM handler in `Worker.init_signals()` (gunicorn/workers/base.py:169),
  which runs BEFORE `load_wsgi()` (base.py:157) -- so installing our
  handler from `create_app()` chains onto gunicorn's handler rather
  than racing it. We capture the previous handler with
  `signal.getsignal()` and call it after ours so gunicorn still shuts
  down the way it expects.
* The interrupt path writes the turn row WITHOUT chunking/embedding it.
  Chunking calls the embedding server over HTTP; a signal handler must
  not block on the network, and systemd escalates to SIGKILL after
  TimeoutStopSec, which would lose the very turn we are trying to
  save.

If the turn does go on to finish normally after the SIGTERM (the
request thread can outlive the accept loop), the loop replaces the
interrupted marker with the real answer instead of adding a second
assistant turn -- see `AgentLoop._persist_interrupted_turn` and
`AgentLoop.handle_chat_streaming`.

    `events` is a bounded buffer of the NDJSON events the turn has
    emitted so far (2026-10-22). The streaming bubble in the web chat
    is client-side DOM: if the browser refreshes, the bubble is gone
