"""Group chat orchestration — @mentions drive the turns.

Added 2026-10-23 (per Mal): "in the group chat, agents will only respond
if there is an @<agent_name>, but multiple agents can be mentioned in one
message (so eg. '@one @two, please update your git repos' -> one and
two would both have a turn)".

How a group message is handled:

  1. The message is appended to public.group_messages (the canonical
     transcript) as a human message.
  2. The mentions are parsed. Only agents in the group's roster
     (public.group_agents) count; anything else is reported back as an
     unknown mention.
  3. Each mentioned agent takes a turn, in mention order. An agent's
     prompt is: [older group transcript] + [this message] + [what the
     other mentioned agents already said in this same message]. So the
     second agent sees the first agent's answer, which is what makes a
     group chat a group chat.
  4. Each agent's reply is appended to the transcript (author_type
     = 'agent'). The agent's own copy of the turns also lands in its
     own <agent>.turns table, via the normal agent loop -- so agent
     memory, the retraining export and the interrupted-turn guard all
     keep working unchanged.

The turns run SEQUENTIALLY on purpose: the transcript is the shared
state, and a sequential run keeps the order deterministic and lets each
agent read the previous agent's reply.
