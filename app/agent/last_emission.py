"""last_emission — captures the FULL thought stream from a chat.

A "thought stream" is the iteration-by-iteration trace of the
agent's tool-use loop: the assistant's text (or null when it
chose to call a tool), the tool calls it requested, and the
results the tools returned. The complementary module
`last_prompt` only captures the prompt that went INTO one LLM
call; this module captures what CAME OUT plus the loop shape.

Use case: when an agent gives a surprising answer, the operator
opens /admin/last-emission to see exactly which tools it called
and what each tool returned. The "Last raw prompt" view is
useful for "what did the model see" (system prompt + history +
bootstrap + permanent memories + the user message); this view
is useful for "what did the model do" (text + tool calls +
results + final answer).

Per-agent slots (matching last_prompt's pattern): one dict
keyed by agent_name. Overwritten on every chat. The admin
route accepts ?agent=<name> to scope to one agent.

Also captures (2026-10-20):
- `attachments` — the list of file attachments produced by the
  attach_file tool (same shape as user uploads: url, filename,
  content_type, size). Mirrors the `attachments` JSONB column on
  <agent>.turns.
- `trajectory` — the full per-iteration trace dict (same shape
  as the `trajectory` JSONB column on <agent>.turns, Migration
  011). Including `max_tool_iterations` when known so the admin
  view can detect "model fabricated the canned failure text"
  — the message says "40 tool iterations" while the configured
  cap is 500 (see harness memory 2026-10-20 evie turn 279).
