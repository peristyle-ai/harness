"""exec_bash tool — execute a shell command as the install's own Unix user.

Per the operator's 2026-10-14 direction: this is the first write-capable tool. Three
hard rules:
  1. NO sudo, NO su, NO privilege escalation. The command runs
     in this process's own context, with this install's Unix user's
     natural permissions. That user has no sudoers entry for root
     commands; the tool runs subprocess.run() in the current process,
     which is already the install's own process.
  2. The command line is passed through `classify_command()` which
     has a hard-block list (sudo, rm -rf /, mkfs, /etc/passwd,
     curl|sh, etc.) and a soft-flag list (see the patterns in
     app/agent/tools/_safety.py for the current list — the
     LLM-facing summary lives in the system prompt).
  3. Every call lands in the audit log next to the install
     with command, cwd, exit_code, stdout_bytes, stderr_bytes,
     duration_ms, outcome (ok|blocked|confirm_required|error|timeout).

Soft-flag flow (the LLM is taught this in the system prompt):
  1. User asks the agent to do something destructive (e.g. restart harness)
  2. The agent calls exec_bash(command="systemctl --user restart harness")
  3. Tool returns {"ok": false, "requires_confirmation": true, "reason": "..."}
  4. The agent surfaces the reason to the user in chat: "this would kill
     the chat surface — confirm?"
  5. User says "yes go ahead" (or "no, do X instead")
  6. The agent re-calls exec_bash(command="...", confirm=true)
  7. Tool runs the command, returns stdout/stderr/exit_code

Working dir defaults to the operator's home. Output cap is 50KB per
stream (stdout/stderr truncated independently). Default timeout
30s, max 120s. Hard timeout via subprocess.run(timeout=...) plus
a thread-based watchdog for the case where the child process
ignores SIGTERM.
