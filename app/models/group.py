"""Group chat store — persistence for public.groups & friends.

Added 2026-10-23 (per the operator): group chats. An admin creates a group from
the landing page; the group has

  * members  — humans picked from public.users (the canonical user table
    of the peristyle DB), and
  * agents   — members of the harness's installed agent roster (one per
    agent schema) who can be @mentioned in the group's chat.

The canonical transcript is public.group_messages: one row per message
with an explicit author (human / agent / system). Every agent that
takes a turn in the group ALSO writes its own copy of the turns into
its own <agent>.turns table (via the normal agent loop), so agent
memory + the retraining export keep working unchanged.

The group has ONE conversation id (public.groups.conversation_id). It
is reused as the conversation id in each participating agent's schema,
which is how the agent loop writes its turns without a new conversation
per agent.

# The agent name ends up in SQL (the <agent>.conversations table name).
# The name arrives in two forms and they are not interchangeable: the
# DISPLAY form ('EXAMPLE'), which the roster stores and the HMI shows,
# and the SCHEMA form ('example'), which names the table. Postgres folds
# an unquoted identifier to lower case, so the schema is resolved with
# canonical_agent_name() -- which also validates it, because it is
# interpolated into SQL -- while the column keeps the display form.
# The installed agent roster is a config value, but the name still
# travels through the DB (public.group_agents), so it is checked here
# too: defence in depth for a table name.
